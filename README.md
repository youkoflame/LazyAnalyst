# LazyAnalyst
Scripts for doing report writeups in a SOC setting

LazyAnalyst was created due to a lack of SOAR or significant automation capabilities. 
It is designed to be a copy-paste for routine uses in a SOC-type environment
Just update the dictionary and prompts and it will spit out a writeup that you can then paste into your write-up/reporting system
